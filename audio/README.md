# Audio Files Directory

This directory contains audio files for the soundboard application.

## Directory Structure

- `animals/` - Animal sound effects
- `cartoon/` - Cartoon-style sound effects  
- `music/` - Musical instrument sounds
- `nature/` - Nature and environmental sounds
- `tech/` - Technology and electronic sounds

## Adding Audio Files

To add your own audio files:

1. Place audio files in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Update the `data/sounds.json` file to reference your new audio files
3. Ensure audio files are in web-compatible formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)

## Current Placeholder Files

The soundboard is currently configured with placeholder audio file paths. You'll need to add actual audio files to make the soundboard functional.

## Supported Audio Formats

- MP3 (recommended for web compatibility)
- WAV (uncompressed, larger file sizes)
- OGG (open source alternative)

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with hyphens for spaces:
- `cat-meow.mp3`
- `drum-roll.mp3`
- `notification-sound.mp3`
