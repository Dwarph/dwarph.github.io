    "bio": "Hi! I'm Pip - a product designer. I've worked in the XR industry since 2019.\n\nI started off at Ultraleap where I led an interaction r&d team, proving the value of high fidelity hand tracking. We focused on rapid prototyping in Unity, and novel spatial interaction design.\n\nI'm now at FitXR, designing the future of fitness - building xr experiences that work at scale, aiming to actively improve people's lives.\n\nI try to combine simplicity and fun to create designs that feel joyful and inevitable.",
