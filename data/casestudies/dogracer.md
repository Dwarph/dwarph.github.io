## My Role

Senior XR Engineer, leading interaction prototyping, managing the project & team.

---

## About the project

We were asked to build a spatial application for the Leap Motion Controller 2's launch, which worked in desktop mode, with very limited engineering resource & on a short deadline.

---

## The Challenge

Dog Racer is an infamous project at Ultraleap - one which was asked for last minute, with extremely limited understanding of the problem space, limited time to build anything, and one that booted out other, more important projects.

The ask was to build a consumer ready app in four weeks, ready to release alongside the Leap 2 launch. We had little user understanding, and not much more to go on from that. From an interaction perspective, we were aware that spatial interaction on a 2D screen, with a 3D representation of your hand was **much** harder than designing in XR.

## The Solution

### Reframe a bad situation

I include this project in my portfolio to highlight that a good thing can come out of a bad situation! When we were given this project, the team began to dispair, and morale was very low - the initial request was for a 3D-Painting app, and the project very quickly began to be referred to as 3D-Pain.

To begin to turn things around, I began to take control of the situation - renaming the codename of the project to 3D-Joy (!) and building a rapid application prototyping plan to get us to an end point of the project. My hope was that at the very least, we could get a fun interaction prototype out of the other end.

I put forward a plan of:

- 1x week interaction scouting
- 1x week of application prototyping
- 2x weeks of productionising the application

### Quickly gain an understanding of our user needs

With limited time, I drafted in different people to help - product presented their hypothesis of the type of users we were targetting, and their needs, and I researched into previous 2D, spatial hand tracking applications, presenting my findings to the group. As this app was for the Leap2, we also focused heavily on the user flow for how we could help convert potential Leap2 buyers. 

### Building the app

I focused the team's initial interaction scouting week on the following:

Themes:
- Interactions which enhance, and improve mesh sculpting
- Hand representations which afford sculpting, communicate the active interaction and feel good
- Application objectives, giving our users a sense of purpose and joy

Evaluation Lenses:
- Easy to learn, simple to teach
- Sharable / Gifable
- Simplicity

We ran it like a game jam - encouraging 1x day timeboxes on each idea, and making sure we were all together in the office whilst it happened.

For the following week, we analysed what the most promising prototypes were and tried to find common threads through them - finding ways to put them all together, building a storyboard out of our ideas & then user testing the final prototype.

Matt Filer & Julia Ronneberger polished the prototype up over the remaining two weeks, whilst I reviewed their progress and worked on other mission critical tasks for the Leap 2 launch.

The final result was a fun spatial interaction game, where you created, raced, and puppeteered a dog - it often got a lot of laughs from people playing it. We open sourced key interactions from it, and Taru wrote [a great blog post](https://docs.ultraleap.com/ultralab/spatial-design-for-2d.html) detailing our learnings.

## Impact

Dog Racer didn't set the world on fire, and probably didn't sell any extra Leap2s, but it did provide us with a good set of spatial interaction learnings for 2D screens, which we were then able to pass onto customers and users of our devices.

We managed to turn what was quite a high pressure, tight deadline into a fun activity. Whilst it still lives in infamy inside of Ultraleap, it ended up having some real world worth to designers and developers of 2D applications.
