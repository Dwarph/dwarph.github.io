                For my Applied Graphics module we had to make a 1-2 minute 3D animated video using blender. I chose to use a low poly style as it was the best way to make something look good, whilst keeping creation difficulty down.
                I was awarded a First for my animation and accompanying making of video.

                </p>

                <p>This was a group project, as part of my second year of university. My role within my team was Lead Architect - I was in charge of the majority of the backend of the program, making sure it followed all the
                given requirements and interacted nicely with the UI. This role was great as it pushed me as a programmer and by neccessity gave me opportunity to lead and delegate various tasks to the rest of the group,
              whilst also reporting back to our group leader.<br /> We were awarded a First for our finished program. </p>

                <h3>Bonks And Zaps <small>(2016, Java)</small></h3>
                As the final project for a first year module, I had to create a game similar to Conway’s Game of Life that our Lecturer had come up with, called “Bonks and Zaps”.
                Bonks and Zaps live in a grid, bonks reproduce together, Zaps kill bonks, both move squares within the grid each cycle.
                As well as completing the main part of the assignment, we were awarded extra marks for flair.
                I gave the Zaps basic “morality” – the more bonks they killed, the less likely they were to commit the murder.
                I also added the ability to fire the Zaps, upon which the program would generate a random backstory of what happened to the fired Zap.
                My main challenge was creating a scalable generated grid within a console based environment, creating the entire program from scratch and coming up with a good system for the backstories.<br />
                I was awarded a First for the assignment.

                I have run a blog called <a href="https://medium.com/pip-writes-stuff/">Pip Writes Stuff</a> since 2014. I write and post two posts a week to my blog.
                Recently my blog has begun to focus on smaller games and their makers - I've run a weekly feature since 2015 called <a href="https://medium.com/pip-writes-stuff/tagged/itching-for-more">"Itching For More"</a>,
                which focuses on small, unknown alt games, primarily sourced from itch.io. On top of this, I've begun to interview the developers behind smaller games, in a series called
                <a href="https://medium.com/pip-writes-stuff/tagged/altgames-innovators">"Altgames' Innovators"</a>.
                My writing has been featured twice (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/08/23/the-sunday-papers-368/">1</a>,
                <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/05/01/the-sunday-papers-403/">2</a>) on Rock Paper Shotgun's Sunday Papers.
