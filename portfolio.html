            <h3>3D Scene made with Three.js<small> (2017, JavaScript, Three.js)</small></h3> For my Computer Graphics And Games module, our assignment was to make a series of rooms using Three.js. As the assignment's purpose was to help us learn how to effectively use graphics libraries, I challenged myself to create everything using
            Three.js. Due to this, a lot of the models in this project are primitive, but I now have a greater appreciation of graphics libraries. I am particularly proud that I managed to create a procedurally generated tree in the limited time I had,
            using a space colonisation algorithm. I was awarded a First for the project.

              nicely with the UI. This role was great as it pushed me as a programmer and by neccessity gave me opportunity to lead and delegate various tasks to the rest of the group, whilst also reporting back to our group leader.<br /> We were awarded

            <h3>Bonks And Zaps <small>(2016, Java)</small></h3> As the final project for a first year module, I had to create a game similar to Conway’s Game of Life that our Lecturer had come up with, called “Bonks and Zaps”. Bonks and Zaps live in a grid, bonks reproduce together, Zaps kill bonks, both
            move squares within the grid each cycle. As well as completing the main part of the assignment, we were awarded extra marks for flair. I gave the Zaps basic “morality” – the more bonks they killed, the less likely they were to commit the murder.
            I also added the ability to fire the Zaps, upon which the program would generate a random backstory of what happened to the fired Zap. My main challenge was creating a scalable generated grid within a console based environment, creating the
            entire program from scratch and coming up with a good system for the backstories.<br /> I was awarded a First for the assignment.
